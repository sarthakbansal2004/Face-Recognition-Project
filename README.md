# 👤 Face Recognition Project

A complete **Face Recognition System** built using **Python 🐍**, **OpenCV 📸**, and the **face-recognition** library 🧠.  
This project can **detect and recognize human faces** from images or a live webcam feed 🎥. It is perfect for real-world applications like **attendance systems 📝**, **security 🔒**, **access control 🚪**, and other face-based automation systems 🤖.

## 📌 Project Overview

Face Recognition is a **biometric technology** that identifies or verifies a person using their facial features 😃.  
This project works by:  
1. **Detecting faces** in images or video frames  
2. **Extracting unique facial encodings** (like a digital fingerprint for your face)  
3. **Matching them with known faces** stored in a dataset 📂  

This system is **simple, beginner-friendly, and easy to customize**, making it ideal for learning **computer vision** and **machine learning concepts** 💡.
